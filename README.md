# UnityMaterialReplacer
Simple Editor Script to (mass) replace materials on selected objects.

It works by searching materials based on name on selected objects and replaces them with the replace material. Caution: Duplicate materials with the same name all get replaced.

## Installation:
Place the script in Assets/Editor/ (or an editor folder of your choice). Tool can be found in Windows > MaterialReplacer.
